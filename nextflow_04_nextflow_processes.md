# Nextflow Processes  

In Nextflow a **process** is the basic processing *primitive* to execute a user script.  

The process definition starts with the keyword `process`, followed by process name and finally the process body delimited by curly brackets.  

The process body must contain a string which represents the command or, more generally, a script that is executed by it. A basic process looks like the following example:  

``` 
process sayHello {
    """
    echo 'Hello world!' > file
    """
}
``` 

A *process* may contain 5 definition blocks:  
1.  directives  
2.  inputs  
3.  outputs  
4.  when clause  
5.  procss script   

```  
process < name > {

   [ directives ]

   input:
    < process inputs >

   output:
    < process outputs >

   when:
    < condition >

   [script|shell|exec]:
   < user script to be executed >

}
```  


## Script  
`script` block is a string statement, that defines the command that is executed by the process to carry out its task.  

* A process contains **only one** script block. It must be the last statment, when the process contains *input* and *output* declarations.  
* The string statement is executed as *bash* in the host system. It can be *command*, *script* or combination of them (as you usually use in terminal shell or bash script).  
* String block can be simple string or multi-line string.  
eg:  
```  
process doMoreThings {
  """
  blastp -db $db -query query.fa -outfmt 6 > blast_result
  cat blast_result | head -n 10 | cut -f 2 > top_hits
  blastdbcmd -db $db -entry_batch top_hits > sequences
  """
}
```  

Like in bash, strings delimited by `"` character support variable substitutions, while strings delimited by `'` do not.  

In the above code `$db` variable is replaced by actual value defined somewhere in the pipline script.   

When you want to acess environment varialbe when using `"` , you need to use `\` character:  
```  
rocess doOtherThings {
  """
  blastp -db \$DB -query query.fa -outfmt 6 > blast_result
  cat blast_result | head -n $MAX | cut -f 2 > top_hits
  blastdbcmd -db \$DB -entry_batch top_hits > sequences
  """
}
```
